# KennyGame

## 100 Days Of Swift & iOS

Built a simple "Catch The Kenny Game" today. I practiced on Swift about Optionals, Alerts, Timer, UserDefaults and Gesture Recognizers.

The highest score is saved to UserDefaults.

If the user's score is greater than 3 Level UP! If it's not user needs to play again. 

Time is limited for 10 seconds. 

Have fun! :)
